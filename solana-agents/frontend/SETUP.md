# Xade Agents Frontend Setup Guide

## Quick Start

The frontend is now fully set up and ready to use! Here's what you need to do to get it running:

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in this directory with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_API_KEY=your_deployer_api_key
VITE_DEPLOYER_URL=http://54.166.244.200
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy and paste the contents of `solana-agents-table-schema.sql` and run it
4. This will create the `solana_agents` table with comprehensive agent details and proper security policies

**Note**: The new `solana_agents` table stores comprehensive information including:
- Auto-generated UUID as agent ID
- User details (ID and email)
- Agent configuration and prompt
- AWS URL and owner address
- Agent wallet (extracted from logs/status)
- Deployment status and timestamps

### 3. Start Development Server

The server is already running! If you need to restart it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

**Note**: The app should now load without any import errors. You'll see the authentication page even without Supabase credentials configured.

3. **Test the authentication flow**
4. **Deploy a test bot** to verify the integration
5. **Customize the UI** as needed for your brand

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
   - Make sure your `.env` file is in the frontend directory
   - Verify the variable names match exactly

2. **Database errors**
   - Ensure you've run the `database-schema.sql` in Supabase
   - Check that RLS policies are enabled

3. **API connection issues**
   - Verify the deployer API is running at `http://54.166.244.200`
   - Check that your API key is correct

4. **Build errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify network requests in the browser dev tools
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

## Production Deployment

When ready to deploy:

1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting platform
3. Set environment variables in your hosting platform
4. Ensure your Supabase project allows your production domain

The frontend is now complete and ready for use! ðŸš€
